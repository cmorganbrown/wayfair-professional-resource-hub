# How Interior Designers Are Building $750K+ Practices with Custom Millwork and Built-In Solutions

*A comprehensive guide to maximizing profitability through strategic millwork partnerships and custom fabrication services*

---

## Executive Summary

Marcus Rivera's interior design firm was trapped in a profit-killing cycle. Despite completing 40+ projects annually, his standard furniture approach was generating razor-thin margins. High-end clients demanded unique solutions, but his suppliers offered only catalog options. The breaking point came when a $1.2 million penthouse client walked away because Marcus couldn't deliver the custom built-ins they envisioned.

Six months later, Marcus had transformed his practice into a $750,000 annual revenue powerhouse. The secret? Mastering custom millwork and built-in solutions that commanded premium pricing while solving clients' most complex space challenges.

This transformation wasn't accidentalâ€”it was a systematic approach to custom fabrication that's revolutionizing how interior designers build profitable, differentiated practices.
