## The $127,000 Annual Revenue Transformation Through Strategic Trade Pricing

Michelle Chen ran a successful interior design practice in Seattle for six years, earning consistent revenue but struggling with the thin profit margins that plague most designers.

## Understanding the Trade Pricing Landscape

**The Hidden World of Professional Furniture Pricing**

The furniture industry operates on a complex pricing structure designed to reward professional buyers while protecting retail margins. Understanding this system is essential for designers who want to build profitable businesses rather than just break even.

### **The Four Tiers of Furniture Pricing**
**Retail Pricing (Consumer Level):**
- **Markup from manufacturer:** 50-100% above wholesale cost
- **Target audience:** Individual consumers and small-volume buyers
- **Service level:** Basic customer service and standard delivery
