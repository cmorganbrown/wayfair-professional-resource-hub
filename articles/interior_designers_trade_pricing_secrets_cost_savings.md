## The $127,000 Annual Revenue Transformation Through Strategic Trade Pricing

Michelle Chen ran a successful interior design practice in Seattle for six years, earning consistent revenue but struggling with the thin profit margins that plague most designers. Her annual revenue of $485,000 seemed impressive, but after business expenses, vendor costs, and time investments, her take-home profit barely covered her personal expenses and business growth ambitions.

- **Standard markup capability:** 25-35% over retail pricing
- **Annual furniture spending:** $295,000 at retail pricing
- **Gross profit margin:** 18% after all business expenses
- **Annual profit:** $87,300 (struggling to fund business growth)

**The Traditional Pricing Struggle:**

## Understanding the Trade Pricing Landscape

**The Hidden World of Professional Furniture Pricing**

The furniture industry operates on a complex pricing structure designed to reward professional buyers while protecting retail margins. Understanding this system is essential for designers who want to build profitable businesses rather than just break even.

### **The Four Tiers of Furniture Pricing**
**Retail Pricing (Consumer Level):**
- **Markup from manufacturer:** 50-100% above wholesale cost
- **Target audience:** Individual consumers and small-volume buyers
- **Service level:** Basic customer service and standard delivery
