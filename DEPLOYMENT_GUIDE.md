## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository** (5 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository:
   - Repository name: `wayfair-professional-resource-hub`
   - Description: `B2B content hub for Wayfair Professional with searchable articles and resources`
   - Make it **Public** (required for Railway free tier)
   - **Don't** initialize with README (we already have files)

2. **In your terminal/command prompt**, navigate to your project folder and run:
   ```bash
   # Initialize git (if not already done)
   git init
   
   # Add all files
   git add .
   
   # Create initial commit
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Wayfair Professional Resource Hub"
   
   # Connect to your GitHub repository
   git remote add origin https://github.com/cmorganbrown/wayfair-professional-resource-hub.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify**: Check GitHub - you should see all your files uploaded

1. **Create Railway Account**:

   - Build process takes ~2-5 minutes

4. **Get Your Live URL**:
   - Once deployed, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
